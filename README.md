# Alex Le's Portfolio
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site built using Typescript, MUI, Tailwind CSS, and is open source.

## Getting Started


To start developing, install Node.js and its dependencies.
```bash
npm i
```

Next, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site live during development.

The site will be editable under the /app directory.


## Deploying for Production
To deploy for production, generate the static files (this site is completely static):

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files will be generated into the /out folder. Place the entire contents
of the /out folder on the website hosting service or server directory to start serving.
